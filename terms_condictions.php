                                    However, if you only cancel a Service add-on or an internet Service add-on, applicable charges continue to apply 
                                    until your next billing date for that add-on.

                                    your account may be removed and/or transferred to a comparable Service plan if the Service or pricing becomes unavailable as a

                                    <p>
                                        You will receive separate bills for your mobile Services and home Services. Service charges will start on 
                                        the Activation Date and are billed in advance. Unless we both agree to a different arrangement, your billing 
                                        period runs for one month, and ends on the bill date noted on the top of your bill. Your Activation Date and 
                                        billing period wonât always start on the same day. When this happens, your Service charges and allotted 
                                        usage are pro-rated for the period between your Activation Date and your bill date. Usage charges, such as 
                                        additional data, airtime, long distance, movie or event purchases and roaming are billed after you use them. 
                                        We may bill you for a charge up to 6 months from the date the charge was incurred.

                                    <p>
                                        Charges on your account are due and payable in full from the date of your bill. If you are paying by mail or 
                                        through a financial institution, please allow adequate time for your payment to reach us before the required 
                                        payment date. You are responsible for all charges on your account.

                                        If we do not receive payment of an amount due on your account by the specified required payment date, it will be subject to a 
                                        late payment charge of 2% per month. This late payment charge will accrue on a daily basis and will be calculated and compounded 
                                        monthly on the outstanding amount (26.82% per year) from the date of the first bill on which it appears until the date we receive 
                                        that amount in full. You agree that we can charge any unpaid and outstanding amount, including any late payment charges, on any 
                                        pre-authorized payment method on your account (e.g., a credit card or bank account withdrawal).

                                    <p>We may apply administrative charges in connection with your account, including as a result of the following:</p>

                                            applicable bill. Failure to notify us within this time period means that you have accepted those charges. 
                                            If any of those discrepancies resulted in unauthorized or incorrect charges on your account, then we will

                                        <p>
                                           We will apply a discount, promotion or benefit to your account as long as you remain eligible for it. We may 
                                           check your eligibility from time to time, and if you become ineligible to receive that discount, promotion 
                                           or benefit for any reason, we may remove it, and/or transfer your Service to a comparable Service plan.

                                            months, we may release and apply the security deposit against your account balance if we determine that your payment history has 
                                            been satisfactory or that you have otherwise met our financial criteria for the return of the security deposit. We may apply your 
                                            security deposit toward your account if you do not pay your bill and we may require you to replenish the security deposit after

                                            applicable interest within 30 days of cancellation of your Services or once we have determined that the conditions for returning 
                                            the security deposit have been met.
